<small>INTRODUCTORY</small></h2>


<p><b>Origins.</b>&mdash;The Japanese are in the main a continental
race. Their language and physical
characteristics show conclusively that they come
from Northern Asia, and geographical considerations
indicate that Korea must have been
their point of embarkation. Indeed a desultory
emigration from Korea to Japan continued into
historical times. When we say Northern Asia
we exclude China. The racial affinity of the
Japanese to the Chinese, of which we hear so
often, really amounts to very little. It is not
closer than that which unites the most distantly
related members of the Indo-European family
of nations. The Japanese themselves have no
traditions of their origin, and it is now impossible
to say what form of religion was professed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
earliest immigrants. No inference can be drawn
from the circumstance that Sun-worship is
common to them with many North-Asiatic races.
The Sun is, or has been, worshipped almost everywhere.
There is distinct evidence of a Korean
element in Shinto, but, with the little that we
know of the old native religion of that country,
anything like a complete comparison is impossible.
Some have recognised a resemblance
between Shinto and the old state religion of
China, and it is true that both consist largely of
Nature-worship. But the two cults differ widely.
The Japanese do not recognise Tien (Heaven),
the chief Nature-deity of the Chinese, nor have
they anything to correspond to their Shangti&mdash;a
more personal ruler of the universe. The Sun
is masculine in China, feminine in Japan. The
Sun-goddess takes precedence of the Earth-god
in Japan, while in China Heaven and Earth
rank above the Sun and Moon. Some Chinese
traits are to be found in the old Shinto documents,
but they are of later origin, and are
readily distinguishable from the native element.
A few similarities exist between Shinto and the
religion of the Ainus of Yezo, a savage race
which once occupied the main island of Japan.
But it is reasonable to suppose that in this case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
the less civilised nation has borrowed from its
more civilised neighbour and conqueror rather
than <i lang="la">vice versa</i>. It is significant that the Ainu
words for God, prayer, and offering, are taken
from the Japanese. If the Malay or Polynesian
element, which some have recognised in the
Japanese race, has any existence, it has left no
trace in religion. Such coincidences as may be
noted between Shinto and oceanic religions, myths
and practices are attributable to the like action
of common causes rather than to inter-communication.
The old Shinto owes little to any outside
source. It is, on the whole, an independent
development of Japanese thought.</p>

<p><b>Sources of Information.</b>&mdash;The Japanese had
no writing until the introduction of Chinese
learning from Korea early in the fifth century
of our era, and the first books which have come
down to us date from the beginning of the
eighth. One of these, called the <cite>Kojiki</cite> (712) is
said to have been taken down from the lips of a
man whose memory was well stored with the
old myths and traditions of his country. He was
perhaps one of the guild of ‘reciters,’ whose
business it was to recite ‘ancient words’ at the
ceremony which corresponds to our coronation.
The <cite>Kojiki</cite> is a repertory of the old myths and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
legends, and, in the latter part, of the ancient
history of Japan. The <cite>Nihongi</cite>, a work of
similar scope, though based more on an existing
written literature, was produced a few years later
(720). It quotes numerous variants of the
religious myths current at this time. There are
voluminous and most learned commentaries on
these two works written by Motoöri and Hirata
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. For
the ritual of Shinto our chief source of information
is the <cite>Yengishiki</cite>, a compilation made early
in the tenth century. It contains, along with
minute directions regarding offerings, ceremonies,
etc., a series of the <i lang="ja">norito</i> (litanies) used in Shinto
worship which are of the highest interest, and of
great, though unequal, antiquity.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned authorities give a tolerably
complete account of the old state religion of
Japan, sometimes called ‘Pure Shinto,’ in order to
distinguish it from the Buddhicised cult of later
times. Its palmy days may be taken to extend
from the seventh to the twelfth century. Shinto,
literally ‘The Way of the Gods,’ is a Chinese
word, for which the Japanese equivalent is <i lang="ja">Kami
no michi</i>.</p>

<small>GENERAL CHARACTER OF SHINTO</small></h2>


<p><b>Kami</b> is the ordinary Japanese word for God.
It means primarily above, superior, and is applied
to many other things besides deities, such as
nobles, the authorities, the ‘missus,’ the hair of
the head, the upper waters of a river, the part
of Japan near Kiōto, etc. Height is in every
country associated with excellence and divinity,
no doubt because the first deities were the Sun
and other Heavenly objects. We ourselves speak
of the ‘Most High’ and use phrases like ‘Good
Heavens’ which testify to a personification of the
sky by our forefathers. But though Kami corresponds
in a general way to ‘God,’ it has some
important limitations. The Kami are high, swift,
good, rich, living, but not infinite, omnipotent, or
omniscient. Most of them had a father and
mother, and of some the death is recorded.
Motoöri, the great Shinto theologian, writing in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
the latter part of the eighteenth century,
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘The term <i lang="ja">Kami</i> is applied in the first place to the
various deities of Heaven and Earth who are mentioned
in the ancient records as well as to their spirits
(<i lang="ja">mi-tama</i>) which reside in the shrines where they are
worshipped. Moreover, not only human beings, but
birds, beasts, plants and trees, seas and mountains,
and all other things whatsoever which deserve to be
dreaded and revered for the extraordinary and pre-eminent
powers which they possess, are called <i lang="ja">Kami</i>.
They need not be eminent for surpassing nobleness,
goodness, or serviceableness alone. Malignant and
uncanny beings are also called <i lang="ja">Kami</i> if only they are the
objects of general dread. Among <i lang="ja">Kami</i> who are human
beings I need hardly mention first of all the successive
Mikados&mdash;with reverence be it spoken.... Then
there have been numerous examples of divine human
beings both in ancient and modern times, who, although
not accepted by the nation generally, are treated as
gods, each of his several dignity, in a single province,
village, or family.... Amongst <i lang="ja">Kami</i> who are not
human beings, I need hardly mention Thunder [in
Japanese <i lang="ja">Naru Kami</i> or the Sounding God]. There
are also the Dragon, the Echo [called in Japanese
<i lang="ja">Ko-dama</i> or the Tree Spirit] and the Fox, who are
<i lang="ja">Kami</i> by reason of their uncanny and fearful natures.
The term <i lang="ja">Kami</i> is applied in the <cite>Nihongi</cite> and <i lang="ja">Manyōshiu</i>
to the tiger and the wolf. Izanagi gave to the fruit
of the peach, and to the jewels round his neck names
which implied that they were <i lang="ja">Kami</i>.... There are <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
many cases of seas and mountains being called <i lang="ja">Kami</i>.
It is not their spirits which are meant. The word
was applied directly to the seas or mountains themselves
as being very awful things.’</p></blockquote>

<p><b>The Kami-Beneficent.</b>&mdash;The saying of the old
Roman poet that ‘Fear first made the Gods’
does not hold good of Shinto. It is rather, as
Schiller called the worship of the gods of Greece,
a <i lang="de">Wonnedienst</i>, a religion inspired by love and
gratitude more than by fear. The three greatest
gods, viz. the Sun-goddess, the Food-goddess, and
Ohonamochi (a god of Earth, the universal provider),
are all beneficent beings, though they may
send a curse when offended by the neglect of
their worship or an insult to their shrines. Their
worshippers come before them with gladness,
addressing them as fathers, parents, or dear divine
ancestors, and their festivals are occasions of
rejoicing. But there are some malevolent or
mischievous deities who have to be propitiated
by offerings. The Fire-god, as is natural in a
country where the houses are built of wood and
great conflagrations are frequent, is one of these,
and, in a lesser degree, the Thunder-god and the
deity of the Rain-storm. The latter has, however,
good points. He provides trees for the use of
humanity, and rescues a maiden from being
devoured by a great serpent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>Lafcadio Hearn’s view that Shinto was at one
time a religion of ‘perpetual fear’ is unsupported
by evidence.</p>

<p><b>Classes of Kami.</b>&mdash;Although the Kami are
deficient in several of the attributes of the
Christian God, they possess two essential qualities
without which it would be impossible to recognise
them as deities at all, viz., sentiency and
superhuman power. The union of these ideas
may be accomplished in two ways, first by attributing
sense and will to the great elemental
objects and phenomena, and secondly by applying
to human and other living beings ideas of
transcendent power derived from the contemplation
of the mighty forces on whose operation we
are daily and hourly dependent for our existence.
We have therefore two classes of deities, Nature-gods
and Man-gods, the first being the result of
personification, the second of deification. It has
been the generally received opinion that the
Shinto gods belong to the latter rather than to
the former of these two categories. Nine out of
ten educated Japanese will declare with perfect
sincerity that Shinto is ancestor-worship. Thus
Mr. Daigoro Goh, a former secretary of the Japan
Society, says:&mdash;‘Shinto or ancestor-worship being
the creed of the ancient inhabitants.’ The same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
view is held by some European scholars, notably
the late Lafcadio Hearn, whose interesting and
valuable work, <cite>Japan, an Interpretation</cite>, is greatly
marred by this misconception. It is quite true
that there is a large element of ancestor worship
in modern Japanese religious practices, but a very
little examination shows that all the great deities
of the older Shinto are not Man, but Nature gods.
Prominent among them we find the deities of
the Sun, the Moon, the Earth, the Sea, the Rain-storm,
Fire, Thunder, etc. And when the so-called
ancestors of the Japanese race are not
actually Nature-gods, they are usually the satellites
or children of Nature-gods. In imitation of
the Mikados who selected the Sun-goddess as
their ancestral deity, the hereditary corporations
or clans by whom in ancient times the Government
of Japan, central and local, was carried on,
chose for themselves, or perhaps invented, nature-deities,
or their children or ministers, as their
patron-gods, to whom special worship was paid.
From this to a belief in their descent from him
as an ancestor, the transition was easy. The
same process has been observed in other countries.
It was assisted by the habit of addressing the
deity as father or parent, which, at first a
metaphorical expression, came ultimately to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
understood in a more literal sense. These pseudo-ancestral
deities were called Ujigami, that is to
say ‘surname-deities.’ In later times the Ujigami
ceased to be the patron-gods of particular families
and became simply the local deities of the district
where one was born. Children are presented to
the Ujigami shortly after birth, and other important
events, such as a change of residence, are
announced to him. A deity of any class may
become an Ujigami, and there have been cases
of a Buddha attaining to this position. The
cult of one’s real forefathers, beginning with
deceased parents, as in China, was hardly known
in ancient Japan. Indeed there is but little trace
of any religious worship of individual men in
the Shinto of the <cite>Kojiki</cite> and <cite>Nihongi</cite>. Living
Mikados were styled Kami, and spoken of as the
‘Heavenly Grandchild’ of the Sun-goddess. But
their godship was more titular than real. It
was much on a par with that of the Pope and
Emperor who in the Middle Ages were called
‘Deus in terris.’ No miraculous powers were
claimed for them beyond a vague general authority
over the minor gods of Japan. Deceased Mikados
were occasionally worshipped by their descendants,
but whether there was anything in this so-called
worship to distinguish it from the ordinary funeral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
or commemorative services there is nothing to
show. They had no shrines, and no rituals in
their honour are preserved in the Yengishiki
collection. At a later period, the cult of deceased
Mikados acquired a more definite character. They
were prayed to for rain, to stay curses, to restore
the Mikado’s health, etc. They had shrines
erected to them, the offerings at which were
assimilated to those made to Nature-deities. The
Mikado Ôjin, if we may believe an oracle delivered
by himself, became an important War-god under
the name of Hachiman. The Empress Jingō,
the legendary conqueror of Korea, also received
divine honours. At the present day, solemn
services are held periodically in the Imperial
Palace for the worship of all the dynasty.</p>

<p>Both categories of deities, Man and Nature
gods, have three subdivisions according as they
are deities of individuals, of classes, or of
qualities. All these are exemplified in Shinto.
The Sun-goddess represents an individual object;
Kukuchi, the god of Trees, a class; and Musubi,
the god of Growth, an abstract quality. Temmangu
is a deified individual statesman, Koyane
represents the Nakatomi clan or family, and Ta-jikara
no wo (hand-strength-male) is a personified
human quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p><b>Development of the Idea of God.</b>&mdash;The Nature-gods
of Shinto, as of other religions, are in the
first place the actual material objects or phenomena
regarded as living beings. Sometimes the
personification proceeds no further. There are
Mud and Sand deities which have no sex, and no
mythical record beyond a bare mention. But in
the case of others the same progressive humanising
process that is to be observed elsewhere has
already begun. The Sun is not only the brilliant
heavenly being whose retirement to a cave leaves
the world to darkness, she is a queen, a child,
and a mother&mdash;in a miraculous fashion. She
speaks, weaves, wears armour, sows seed, and
does many other things which have nothing to
do with her solar quality. At a still more recent
stage&mdash;though not in the old records&mdash;she becomes
an independent personage who rules the
Sun, while with many worshippers at the present
day her solar character is forgotten altogether,
and she is considered merely as a great divine
ancestor who dwells at Ise and exercises a providential
guardianship over Japan. This line of
development is familiar to us in other mythologies,
the two stages of thought being often confounded.
In Shakespeare’s <cite>Tempest</cite>, Iris is at once
the rainbow and an anthropomorphic messenger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
of the gods. Phoebus is not only the sun but a
deity distinct from that luminary, though associated
with it, as in the story of Phaeton. As the
god of music and poetry, his solar function is not
obvious. The same is true of the gods of the Vedas.</p>

<p><b>Impersonality of Shinto.</b>&mdash;The faculty of
imagination was not powerful with the ancient
Japanese. It was active, and produced many
deities of all classes. But they are very feebly
characterised. Indeed, most of them may be
said to have no characters at all. They are
popularly reckoned at eighty myriads, or eight
hundred myriads. Though this is a fanciful
exaggeration, Shinto is a highly polytheistic
religion, and numbers its deities by hundreds,
even if we do not go back to that earlier period
when the rocks, the trees, and the foam of water
had all power of speech. There is a constant
depletion in their ranks by the mere force of
oblivion, while, on the other hand, new deities
come into notice. Different gods are identified
with one another, or the same deities may be
split up like Musubi into a pair, or a number of
distinct persons. The same deity at different
places may have different ranks and attributes.</p>

<p><b>Spiritism.</b>&mdash;The gods of ancient Shinto are, on
the whole, as unspiritual beings as the gods of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Olympus. Their doings are modelled on those
of living men and women, not on those of ghosts.
When Izanagi followed his wife Izanami to the
land of the dead he found there not a spirit, but
a putrefying corpse. Ghosts are as absent from
the <cite>Kojiki</cite> and <cite>Nihongi</cite> as they are from the Old
Testament Scriptures. Herbert Spencer’s ghost-theory
of the origin of religion derives no support
from the Japanese evidence. There is, however,
a spiritual element in Shinto which demands
notice. Some of the gods are represented as
having <i lang="ja">mitama</i> (august jewels or souls) which
reside invisibly in their temples and are the
means of communication between Heaven and
this world. The Earth or Kosmos deity Ohonamochi
had a <i lang="ja">mitama</i> (double) which appeared to
him in a divine radiance illuminating the sea, and
obtained from him a promise that, in consideration
of the assistance the latter had rendered in
reducing the world to order, he should have a
shrine consecrated to him at Mimoro. Susa no
wo’s <i lang="ja">mitama</i> was ‘settled’ at Susa in Idzumo.
The element <i lang="ja">tama</i> (soul) enters into the names
of several deities. This implies a more or less
spiritual conception of their nature. Sometimes
we hear of two <i lang="ja">mitama</i>, one of a gentle, the other
of a violent nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>There are only one or two cases of deceased men
having mitama. In one of these the mitama
takes the shape of a bird. Metamorphoses are
frequently mentioned in the old legends.</p>

<p><b>Shekinah.</b>&mdash;As in the analogous case of the
Shekinah of Judaism, the doctrine of the mitama
of gods apparently does not arise from that of
the separability of the human soul and body. It
seems rather to have been invented in order to
smooth over the difficulty of conceiving how the
gods of Heaven can exercise their power and
hear and answer prayer in their shrines on earth.
It may, however, owe something to the notion of
separate human souls, which, though we do not
find it in the older Japanese records, is familiar
to races of a much lower degree of civilisation.</p>

<p><b>Immortality of the Soul.</b>&mdash;This doctrine is
nowhere directly taught in the Shinto books.
There is a land of Yomi to which we are told
that some of the gods retired at death. It is
represented as inhabited by various personifications
of death and disease, but not by human
beings or their ghosts, though the phrase ‘even
pass of Yomi,’ like the <i lang="la">facilis descensus Averni</i>,
seems intended to express the facility with which
all we mortal men find our way thither. In one
passage of the <cite>Nihongi</cite>, Yomi is clearly no more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
than a metaphor for the grave. A brother of
Jimmu Tenno, the first Mikado, is said to have
gone to the ‘Eternal Land’ at his death, and in
a poem of the Manyōshiu, a deceased Mikado is
said to have ascended into heaven. The prehistoric
custom of sacrificing wives and attendants
at the tombs of dead sovereigns may be
thought to imply a belief in their continued
existence. But there are other motives for this
practice than the wish to gratify the deceased by
providing him with companions in the other
world. The <i lang="ja">norito</i> or rituals contain no reference
to the immortality of the soul.</p>

<p><b>Shintai.</b>&mdash;The mitama is represented in the
shrine by a concrete object termed the Shintai
or ‘God-body.’ It may be a mirror, a sword, a
tablet with the god’s name, a pillow, a spear, etc.
A round stone, which is cheap and durable, is a
very common Shintai. The god is sometimes
represented as attaching himself to the Shintai,
and may be even considered identical with it by
the ignorant. The <i lang="ja">mitama</i> and <i lang="ja">shintai</i> are frequently
confounded. The latter was in many
cases originally an offering which, by long association,
came ultimately to be looked upon as
partaking in some measure of the divine nature.</p>

<p><b>Idols.</b>&mdash;With a few unimportant exceptions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Shinto has no idols. The Shintai is not in the
least anthropomorphic. The pictures of the gods
sold at shrines at the present day are due to
Chinese or Buddhist influence.</p>

<p><b>Functions of Gods.</b>&mdash;The two great classes of
deities, Nature-gods and Man-gods, have a tendency
mutually to encroach on each other’s
functions, so that ultimately they become assimilated
under the one general term Kami. As we
have seen above, the Sun-goddess does not confine
herself to her function as a giver of light and
heat, but does many things characteristic of a
magnified human being. Susa no wo, the Rain-storm,
provides mankind with useful trees. He
and his wife are regarded as gods of wedlock.
Inari, the Grain-god, is a comprehensive answerer
of prayer from a petition for a good harvest to
one for the restoration of stolen property. On
the other hand, a genuine deified man like
Temmangu may send rain in time of drought.
An obscure deity, known as Suitengu, is worshipped
in Tokio at the present day as a protector
against the perils of the sea, burglary, and the
pains of parturition. Almost any Kami, whatever
his origin, may send rain, bestow prosperity in
trade, avert sickness, cure sickness or sterility, and
so on, without much discrimination of function.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />

<small>MYTH</small></h2>


<p><b>Character of Japanese Myth.</b>&mdash;Japanese myth
covers much the same ground as the myths of
other countries. We have the explanatory myth,
invented in order to account for some custom or
rite, some natural phenomenon, a name of a place
or person, etc. There is an abundance of highly
frivolous, revolting, childish, and unmeaning&mdash;to
us at least&mdash;matter, and the various versions of
the stories which have come down to us are often
wholly inconsistent with one another. From the
sketch of the mythical narrative which is given
below, many details of this description have
necessarily been omitted. There are, however,
two leading ideas by which Japanese myth is
redeemed from summary condemnation as a mere
farrago of childish nonsense. In the first place,
it is permeated by the conception of the so-called
inanimate universe as being in reality instinct
with sentient life. The old Shintoists had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
grasped the more general and philosophic notion
of the Immanence of Deity in all things. With
their limited scientific knowledge this was impossible.
But they had the same idea in a more
desultory, fragmentary way. To them, the Sun,
the Wind, the Sea, were <i lang="ja">Kami</i> who could hear
and answer prayer, and exercise a providential
care over mankind. But the synthesis of these
and other aspects of nature and humanity into
one divine whole is necessarily wanting. The
second idea which inspires Japanese myth corresponds
to our European notion of the divine right
of kings, which, apart from the accident of
heredity, is not such a negligible quantity as is
sometimes supposed. The Mikados are represented
as deriving their authority, whether as
high-priests or sovereigns, from their ancestor,
the Sun-goddess, and have, therefore, a divinely
ordered right to the reverence and obedience of
their subjects.</p>

<p>There is no summer and winter myth in the
old records, no deluge myth, and no eclipse myth.
The stars are strangely neglected. Earthquakes
are hardly noticed. There is no Returning
Saviour myth, and no Journey of the Dead,
though the expressions ‘Even Pass of Hades’
and <i lang="ja">Yaso-kumade</i> (eighty-road-windings, an alter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>native
word for the land of Darkness) suggest
that this idea was not unknown. The creation
of mankind generally is not accounted for; but
the origin of many of the ruling caste is ascribed
to direct descent from the principal divinities,
just as the Mikado is said to be descended from
the Sun-goddess.</p>

<p><b>First Gods.</b>&mdash;Four different first gods are mentioned
by the various authorities. None of these
ever attained to much importance. They were
no doubt collected or invented with the purpose
of eking out a genealogical tree for the greater
divinities who came afterwards. One of these,
called <i lang="ja">Ame yudzuru hi ame no sagiri Kuni
yudzuru tsuki Kuni no sagiri</i>, is described as
the Heavenly Parent. But we know nothing
more about him or her&mdash;the sex is doubtful&mdash;and
it is impossible to regard this interminable title
as the name of a real god, any more than we can
think that Shakespeare’s <em>honorificabilitudinitatibus</em>
was ever meant for a genuine word. The
derivation, however, shows that this, like the
other first gods, was intended as a nature-deity.
The four generations which follow consist of
obscure personages, all of whom disappear at once
from the record. Their names, too, are suggestive
of nature, and more especially agriculture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>-deities.
In the sixth generation we find two
deities, named <i lang="ja">Kami-musubi</i> and <i lang="ja">Taka-musubi</i>,
<i lang="ja">i.e.</i> High-growth and Divine-growth, who were of
some importance in later times.</p>

<p><b>Izanagi and Izanami.</b>&mdash;With these two deities
Japanese myth really begins.</p>

<p>The <cite>Nihongi</cite> tells us that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Izanagi and Izanami stood on the floating bridge of Heaven (the
rainbow) and held counsel together, saying “Is there not a country
beneath?” Thereupon they thrust down the “Jewel-Spear of Heaven,” and
groping about with it, found the ocean. The brine which dripped from
the point of the spear coagulated and formed an island which received
the name of Onogoro-jima or the “Self-Coagulating Island.” The two
deities thereupon descended and dwelt there. Accordingly they wished to
be united as husband and wife, and to produce countries. So they made
Onogoro-jima the pillar of the centre of the land.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The <cite>Kojiki</cite> says that Izanagi and Izanami were
commanded by all the heavenly deities ‘to regulate
and fully consolidate’ the floating land beneath.
But all the accounts, the <cite>Kojiki</cite> included,
proceed to represent the islands of Japan as having
been generated by them in the ordinary manner.
We have therefore three distinct conceptions of
creation in Japanese myth&mdash;first, as generation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
in the most literal sense; second, as reducing to
order; and third, as growth (<i lang="ja">Musubi</i>).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘The two deities having descended on Onogoro-jima erected there
an eight-fathom house with an august central pillar. Then Izanagi
addressed Izanami, saying, “Let me and thee go round the heavenly
august pillar, and having met at the other side, let us become united
in wedlock.” This being agreed to, he said, “Do thou go round from the
left, and I will go round from the right.” When they had gone round,
Izanami spoke first and exclaimed, “How delightful! I have met a
lovely youth.” Izanagi then said, “How delightful! I have met a lovely
maiden.” Afterwards he said, “It was unlucky for the woman to speak
first.” The child which was the first offspring of their union was the
Hiruko (leech-child), which at the age of three was still unable to
stand upright, and was therefore placed in a reed-boat and sent adrift.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Izanagi and Izanami then procreated the islands
of Japan with a number of other gods, among
whom were <i lang="ja">Iha-tsuchi-biko</i> (rock-earth-prince),
<i lang="ja">Oho-ya-biko</i> (great-house-prince), the Wind-gods,
a variety of marine deities, <i lang="ja">Ame no Mikumari</i>
(the heavenly water distributor), the god of Moors
(who is also the god of Herbs and Grasses), the
god of Trees, the gods of Mountains and Valleys,
and the goddess of Food. The last deity to be
produced was the god of Fire, <i lang="ja">Kagu-tsuchi</i>, also
called <i lang="ja">Ho-musubi</i> (Fire-growth). In giving birth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
to him, Izanami was burnt so that she sickened
and lay down. From her vomit, fæces, and urine
were born deities which personify the elements of
metal, water, and clay. When Izanami died,
Izanagi, in his grief and rage, drew his sword and
slew Kagu-tsuchi, thereby generating a number of
other deities, two of whom, named Take-mika-tsuchi
and Futsunushi, were favourite objects of
worship in later times.</p>

<p>The creation of the Sun and Moon is variously
accounted for. Some say that they were the
children of Izanagi and Izanami, others that they
were born from the lustrations of Izanagi when
he returned from Yomi. A third child, Susa no
wo, the boisterous and unruly Rain-storm god,
was produced at the same time.</p>

<p>When Izanami died she went to the Land of
Yomi, whither she was followed by her husband.
But as she had already eaten of the food of that
region, he could not bring her back with him.
She forbade him to look on her, but he persisted
and saw that she was already a putrid corpse.
Izanami then complained that he had put her to
shame, and caused him to be pursued by the
Ugly Females of Hades and other personifications
of corruption and disease who dwelt there. She
herself had become Death personified. Izanagi,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
in his flight, flung down various objects which
delayed his pursuers&mdash;a well-known incident
of myth&mdash;until he reached the Even Pass of
Hades, where he pronounced the formula of
divorce.</p>

<p>When Izanagi returned to earth he bathed in
the sea in order to remove the pollution incurred
by his visit to Yomi, and in so doing produced a
number of deities, some of whom are Ocean-gods
and others associated with the ancient Japanese
ceremonies of religious purification.</p>

<p><b>Susa no wo and the Sun-Goddess.</b>&mdash;Susa no wo
(the Rain-storm god) was at first appointed to rule
the Sea, but he preferred to join his mother,
Izanami, in Hades, and was accordingly despatched
thither by his father. Before taking
his departure, however, he ascended to heaven
to take leave of his elder sister Amaterasu, the
Sun-goddess. All the mountains and rivers shook,
and every land and country quaked as he passed
upwards. Amaterasu, in alarm, armed herself as
a warrior with sword and bow, stamped her feet
into the hard ground up to her thighs, kicking
away the earth like rotten snow, and, confronting
him like a valiant man, challenged him to declare
the reason of his coming. Susa no wo protested
that it was only a friendly visit, and as a proof of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
his good intentions proposed that they should produce
children between them by each one crunching
in his mouth and spurting out fragments of the
sword and jewels worn by the other. One of the
children thus born was called <i lang="ja">Masaya a katsu
kachi hayahi ama no oshihomimi</i>, the forefather
of the present Imperial dynasty. There were
seven others who figure largely in the genealogies
of the Japanese nobility.</p>

<p>But the true nature of the Rain-storm god was
not long repressed. He destroyed his sister’s rice-fields,
defiled the sacred hall where she was celebrating
the harvest festival, and flung a piebald
colt that had been flayed backwards into the
sacred weaving-room where the garments of the
gods were woven. The Sun-goddess had borne
his previous outrages with calmness and forbearance,
but this last (a malicious magical practice?)
was beyond endurance. She retired in disgust
and shut herself up in the Rock-cave of Heaven,
leaving the world to darkness. This proceeding
of Amaterasu was followed by dire results. ‘The
voices of the evil deities were like unto the flies
in the fifth moon as they swarmed, and a myriad
portents of woe arose.’ The gods, in consternation,
held an assembly in the dry bed of the River of
Heaven (the Milky Way) to devise means for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
inducing her to emerge from the cave, and a number
of expedients were adopted which were evidently
borrowed from the ritual of the time when the
myth became current. The deities who were specially
concerned with this duty are obvious counterparts
of the actual officials of the Mikado’s Court,
and included a prayer-reciter, an offering-provider,
a mirror-maker, a jewel-maker, a diviner, with&mdash;according
to some accounts&mdash;many others. All
this is most convenient for the genealogists of
later times. Amaterasu at length reappeared, to
the great delight of everybody. Susa no wo was
fined in a thousand tables of offerings and expelled
from Heaven. Before proceeding to Yomi,
he went down to Earth. Here he appears in a
totally new character as the Perseus of a Japanese
Andromeda, whom he rescues from a huge serpent,
having first intoxicated the monster. Of
course they are married and have numerous
children. Her name, Inada-hime (rice-land-lady),
is probably not without significance as that of the
wife of a Rain-storm god. Another story represents
him as the murderer of the Food-goddess,
who had offended him by producing viands for
his entertainment from various parts of her body.
But a different version ascribes this crime to the
Moon-god, and gives it as the reason why the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Sun-goddess refused to have any further relations
with him. This, of course, explains why the two
luminaries are not seen together.</p>

<p>Here it may be pointed out that, notwithstanding
the anthropomorphic character of many
of the above details it is evidently the sun itself
which is concealed in the Rock-cave. Modern
Euhemerists deny this. But the evidence is far
too strong to be disregarded. Her names, Amaterasu
(Heaven Shining-one) and Hirume (Sun-female),
are conclusive on this point. The modern
commentator Motoöri agrees, or rather maintains,
that Amaterasu is the very sun which we see in
heaven. Those Japanese who in the twentieth
century talk of the imperial visit to Ise as
ancestor-worship are sorely puzzled to justify
their position. Imbued with the philosophy of
China and the science of Europe, they naturally
find it difficult to understand how the Mikado
can be really descended from the sun. Some
resort to the Euhemeristic theory that she was a
mortal Empress who lived in a place on earth
called Takanna no hara (plain-of-high-heaven),
and speak of rice-culture and the art of weaving
being known in her reign.</p>

<p>The myth of the Sun-goddess and Susa no wo
is the central pivot on which the old mythology<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
turns. All that precedes may be regarded as a sort
of genealogical introduction, and the subsequent
narrative as an epilogue designed to complete the
connexion between the living Mikados and their
celestial ancestor.</p>

<p><b>Ohonamochi.</b>&mdash;One of Susa no wo’s children
was an Earth-god named Ohonamochi (great-name-possessor),
who is at this day a very
important deity. The <cite>Kojiki</cite> relates his adventures
at great length. He was badly treated
by his eighty elder brothers, but assisted by a
hare to whom he had rendered service. He went
down to the land of Yomi, where he married the
daughter of Susa no wo. Susa no wo imposed
tasks upon him which by his wife’s assistance he
performed successfully, and ultimately made his
escape, taking her with him. The Yomi of this
narrative has little that is characteristic of the
abode of the Dead. Ohonamochi is frequently
referred to as the ‘God who made the land,’ and
his various names show that he is an Earth-god.
He was assisted in reducing the country to order
by his own <i lang="ja">mitama</i> or double, and by a dwarf-god
called Sukuna-bikona, who came from beyond the
sea and is credited with having instructed mankind
in the arts of medicine and brewing.
Ohonamochi had a numerous progeny by various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
mothers. Among them were the Harvest-god
and the Food-goddess. The <cite>Kojiki</cite> gives a
genealogy of them and their descendants, most
of whom are wholly unknown to us.</p>

<p><b>Ninigi.</b>&mdash;Meanwhile the Sun-Goddess became
desirous of establishing the rule of her own
grandchild Ninigi, son of Masaya a katsu, in
Japan. After several fruitless attempts to prepare
the country for his reception by purging it
of the swarms of evil deities which infested it,
two gods named Take-mika-tsuchi (Thunder?)
and Futsunushi (Fire?) were sent to summon
Ohonamochi to yield over his authority. After
some demur he did so, and Ninigi was accordingly
despatched to earth, accompanied by a long train
of attendants who provide further material for
the genealogists. They descended on a mountain
in Kiushiu. Here Ninigi took to wife a Mountain-god’s
daughter, named Konohana Sakuya-hime
(the lady who blossoms like the flowers of the
trees), rejecting as too ugly her elder sister Iha-naga-hime
(the rock-long-lady). The latter,
indignant at this slight, uttered a curse:&mdash;‘The
race of visible men shall change swiftly like the
flowers of the trees, and shall decay and pass
away.’ Hence the shortness of human life. By
Konohana Ninigi had three children. The eldest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Ho no Susori, became a fisherman, the second son,
Hohodemi, a hunter.</p>

<p>Ho no Susori once proposed to his brother to
exchange their respective callings. Hohodemi
accordingly gave over to his elder brother his
bow and arrows and received a fish-hook in
return. But neither of them profited by the
exchange, so Ho no Susori gave back to his
brother the bow and arrows and demanded from
him the fish-hook.</p>

<p>Hohodemi, however, had in the meantime lost
it in the sea. He took his sword and forged from
it a number of new fish-hooks which he piled up
in a winnowing tray and offered to his brother by
way of compensation. But the latter would have
none but his own, and demanded it so vehemently
of Hohodemi as to grieve him bitterly. Hohodemi
went down to the sea-shore and stood there
lamenting, when there appeared to him the Old
Man of the Sea, by whose advice he descended
into the sea-depths to the abode of the god of the
Sea, a stately palace with lofty towers and battlements.
Before the gate there was a well, and
over the well grew a thick-branching cassia tree
into which Hohodemi climbed. The Sea-god’s
daughter Toyo-tama-hime (rich-jewel-maiden)
then came out from the palace to draw water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
She saw Hohodemi’s face reflected in the well,
and returning within reported to her father that
she had seen a beautiful youth in the tree which
grew by the well. Hohodemi was courteously
received by the Sea-god, Toyo-tama-hiko (rich-jewel-prince),
who, when he heard his errand,
summoned before him all the fishes of the sea
and made inquiry of them for the lost fish-hook,
which was eventually discovered in the mouth of
the Tai. Toyo-tama-hiko delivered it to Hohodemi,
telling him when he gave it back to his
brother to say, ‘a hook of poverty, a hook of ruin,
a hook of downfall,’ to spit twice, and to hand it
over with averted face.</p>

<p>Hohodemi married the Sea-god’s daughter
Toyo-tama-hime and remained with her for three
years. He then became home-sick and returned
to the upper world. On the beach where he
came to land, he built for his wife, who was soon
to follow, a parturition house which he thatched
with cormorant’s feathers. The roofing was still
unfinished when she arrived, riding on a great
tortoise. She went straight into the hut, begging
her husband not to look at her. But Hohodemi’s
curiosity was too strong for him. He peeped in
and behold! his wife had become changed into a
<i lang="ja">wani</i> (sea-dragon) eight fathoms long. Deeply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
indignant at the disgrace put upon her, Toyo-tama-hime
abandoned her new-born child to the
care of her sister, and barring behind her the sea-path
in such a way that from that day to this all
communication between the realms of land and
sea has been cut off, returned hastily to her
father’s palace.</p>

<p>Hohodemi’s troubles with his elder brother
were renewed on his arrival home. He was
obliged to use against him two talismans given
him by his father-in-law. One of these had the
virtue of making the tide flow and submerge Ho
no Susori and thus compel him to sue for mercy
(another account says that Hohodemi whistled
and thereby raised the wind and the sea). Then
by a second talisman the tide was made to recede
and Ho no Susori’s life was spared. He yielded
complete submission to his younger brother and
promised that he and his descendants to all
generations would serve Hohodemi and his successors
as mimes and bondservants. The <cite>Nihongi</cite>
adds that in that day it was still customary for
the Hayato (or Imperial guards), who were
descended from Ho no Susori, to perform a mimic
dance before the Mikados, the descendants and
successors of Hohodemi, in which the drowning
struggles of their ancestor were represented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>There are several features in this story which
betray a recent origin and foreign influences. A
comparatively advanced civilisation is indicated
by the sword and fish-hook forged of iron. The
institution of the Hayato as Imperial Guards
belongs to a period not very long antecedent to
the date of the <cite>Nihongi</cite> and <cite>Kojiki</cite>. The palace of
the sea-depths and its Dragon-king are of Chinese,
and therefore of recent origin.</p>

<p>One of Hohodemi’s grandchildren was Jimmu
Tennō, who is usually reckoned the first human
sovereign of Japan. He was the youngest of four
brothers and his selection as heir shows that
primogeniture, though to some extent acknowledged
in Ancient Japan, was by no means the
universal rule. At the age of forty-five he started
from Kiushiu, which had been the home of the
Imperial family since Ninigi descended there,
on an expedition for the conquest of the central
part of Japan, known as Yamato. This event
is dated in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 667, 1,792, 470 years after the
descent of Ninigi from heaven. He finally succeeded
in establishing his capital there in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
660. From this date Japanese history is usually
said to begin. In reality there is no genuine
history of Japan for one thousand years more. The
chronology for all this period is a colossal fraud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
and there is abundant intrinsic evidence that the
narrative itself is no better than legend when it is
not absolute fiction. There is, however, much to
be learned from it of the beliefs and customs of
the ancient Japanese.</p>

<p>The descent of the Imperial dynasty from a
Sea-god has been noted as an auspicious omen
for the development of Japan as a great naval
power.</p>

<small>THE GODS</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nature-Gods of Individuals and of Classes</span></h3>

<p>Some of the principal gods have already been
introduced in the preceding chapter. Let us
now consider them separately, according to the
classification already indicated (<a href="#Page_8">p. 8</a>). It is
often difficult to say whether a nature-god represents
an individual object or phenomenon, or a
class. This is chiefly owing to the circumstance
that Japanese, like other Far-Eastern languages,
habitually neglects the distinction between the
singular and the plural number. The idea of
making verbs and adjectives agree in number
with the substantives to which they belong does
not seem to have occurred to these nations, and,
even in the case of nouns and pronouns, plural
particles are very sparingly used. <i lang="ja">Yama no
Kami</i>, for example, may mean either God of the
Mountain, God of Mountains, Gods of the Mountain,
or Gods of Mountains.</p>

<p><b>Amaterasu</b>, the <b>Sun-Goddess</b>.&mdash;The Sun-god<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>dess
belongs unmistakably to the first class, viz.,
that of individual objects personified. She is
much the most prominent member of the Shinto
Pantheon, and is described as the Ruler of
Heaven and unrivalled in dignity. She wears
royal insignia, and is surrounded by a court.
The chief religious ceremony of state was in her
honour. Yet she is not what we should call a
Supreme Deity. She is by no means an autocrat.
Even in heaven, which she is supposed to govern,
there is a Council of the Gods which decides
important matters. In some myths she has a
formidable rival in <i lang="ja">Taka musubi</i>, a god of Growth.</p>

<p>The ascription of the female sex to the deity
of the Sun has more meaning than might be supposed.
Women held a far more important and
independent position in ancient Japan than they
did at a later time when Chinese ideas of their
subjection became prevalent. Several of the
ancient Mikados were women. Old Chinese
books call Japan the ‘Queen-country.’ Women
chieftains are frequently mentioned. Some of
the most important monuments of the old literature
were the work of women.</p>

<p>Like the Sun-Gods of ancient Greece and
Egypt, Amaterasu possesses a sacred bird, the
Yatagarasu, or eight-hand-crow. An old Japanese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
dictionary identifies this bird, rightly in my
opinion, with the Yangwu or Sun-crow of Chinese
myth. The Yangwu is a bird of a red colour
with three legs which inhabits the sun. The
Yatagarasu was lent by the Sun-goddess to
Jimmu Tennō as a guide to his expedition
against the tribes who then held the province
of Yamato. A noble Japanese family claimed
descent from this bird.</p>

<p>The Sun-goddess is represented in the shrine
of Ise by her shintai or token, which is called
the Yatakagami or eight-hand mirror. It is
related that when she sent down her grandchild
Ninigi to rule the earth, she gave him this mirror
with the injunction: ‘Regard this mirror exactly
as our mitama (soul) and reverence it as if
reverencing us.’ At this day the Yatakagami is
held in high reverence. It is kept in a bag of
brocade which is never opened or repaired, a new
one being added on the top of its predecessor
when the latter is too much worn for further use.
The <cite>Nihongi</cite> calls it the ‘Great-God of Ise.’</p>

<p>Amaterasu is not the only Sun-deity of
Japanese myth. We hear of a Waka-hirume
(young-sun-female) who is no doubt a personification
of the morning sun, and of a Nigi-haya-hi
(gentle, swift-sun). The latter is said to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
come down from heaven in a heavenly rock-boat,
and to have become the chieftain of one of
the tribes subdued by Jimmu Tennō. He may,
however, have been a human being named as a
compliment after the Sun. This proceeding is
not unknown in Japanese history. But I rather
suspect that he is a real Sun-god. Then there
is the Hiruko mentioned at <a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a> as the first-born
of all the deities. Now Hiruko, though written
with Chinese characters which mean leech-child,
may also mean Sun-male-child, and this is
obviously its proper meaning. The Hiruko was
a male Sun-deity who afterwards became obsolete.
For some unknown reason Hiruko has
been identified with a popular modern deity
named Yebisu, who has to all appearance nothing
to do with either the sun or the leech. He is
pictured as an angler with a fish dangling at the
end of his line. He has a smiling countenance
and wears old Japanese costume. Merchants
pray to him for success in trade.</p>

<p>At the present day the title Amaterasu no
oho-kami (the great deity who illumines heaven)
is generally replaced by its Chinese equivalent
Tenshōdaijin. The meaning of the latter is less
clear to the uneducated, who forget that she
has any connection with the sun. Sun-worship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
however, proceeds independently. Women and
children especially call it by the respectful name
of Otentō sama, without attribution of sex, with
no formal cult, and no myth, but endowed with
moral attributes, punishing the wicked and rewarding
the just. Dr. Griffis describes a scene
which he witnessed in Tokio when, late one
afternoon, Otentō sama, which had been hidden
behind clouds for a fortnight, shone out on the
muddy streets. In a moment scores of people
rushed out of their houses, and with faces westward
began prayer and worship before the great
luminary. Many people keep awake all night
on the last day of the year so as to worship the
rising sun on the first day of the New Year.</p>

<p><b>Tsuki-yomi.</b>&mdash;The Sun being feminine, Tsuki-yomi,
the moon-deity, is naturally masculine.
Though he has shrines at Ise and other places,
he occupies a far less prominent place in Japanese
myth and cult than his elder sister Amaterasu.</p>

<p><b>Susa no wo.</b>&mdash;The true character of this deity
had been forgotten by the Japanese themselves
until he was shown by an American scholar,
Dr. Buckley of Chicago, to be a personification
of the Rain-storm. The generally accepted
etymology of his name derives it from a verb
<i lang="ja">susamu</i>, to be impetuous. This accords well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
with his character as described in the <cite>Kojiki</cite>
and <cite>Nihongi</cite>. Mr. B. H. Chamberlain translates
by ‘the Impetuous Male,’ and he may be correct.
But there is a town in Idzumo called Susa where
this god had a shrine, and it seems possible that
it was from this that he took his name.</p>

<p><b>Star-Gods</b> are few and unimportant in Shinto.</p>

<p><b>Earth-worship.</b>&mdash;The direct worship of the
Earth is well-known in Japan. At the present
day, when a new building is erected or new
rice-land brought under cultivation, the ground
is solemnly propitiated by a ceremony called
Ji-matsuri or earth-worship. Localities were personified
under names which recall Erin, Britannia,
Dea Roma, etc. Such deities were called Kunidama,
country or province spirit. The greatest
of these, and one of the three greatest gods of
Shinto, is Ohonamochi. His shrine at Kitsuki
in Idzumo is known as the Taisha or great
shrine, and he has numerous other shrines, called
Sannō or Hiye, in all parts of the country. In
his case the deification has proceeded beyond the
mere personification of the soil. Legend represents
him as the maker of the land, not the
land itself, and in modern times nobody thinks
of him as an Earth-god. His various names,
however, show conclusively that he is as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
an earth-deity as the Greek Gaia, who, like him,
was ‘one shape of many names.’ Lafcadio Hearn
would make him out to be the god of the dead,
though there are already two other rulers of
Hades, and Dr. Buckley thinks that he is a
Moon-god. With Ohonamochi there is associated
his minister, an important deity named Kotoshiro-nushi,
and a dwarf-god, Sukuna-bikona, who is
credited with the invention of medicine, magic,
and the art of brewing sake.</p>

<p>Another Earth-god is Asuha, an obscure personage,
who is supposed to be the deity of the
courtyard. Mud, sand, and clay are deified under
the names of Uhijini, Suhijini, and Hani-yasu-hime,
the last name meaning clay-easy (in the
sense of plastic) lady. Clay was deified because
it supplied the material for the domestic cooking
furnace, a defence against the encroaches of that
unruly power, fire.</p>

<p><b>Mountain-Gods.</b>&mdash;Most mountains have their
deity, which is sometimes conceived of as the
mountain itself, at others as a god of the mountain.
Mountain gods do not take high rank in
the Shinto Pantheon. They were propitiated
before trees were cut for building purposes.</p>

<p><b>Earthquake-Gods</b> are little heard of. But any
god might cause an earthquake if offended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p><b>Sea-Gods.</b>&mdash;The chief Sea-gods of Shinto are
Sokotsu-wata-dzumi (bottom-sea-body), Nakatsu-wata-dzumi
(middle-sea-body), and Uhatsu-wata-dzumi
(upper-sea-body), three deities produced
from Izanagi’s ablutions in the sea when he returned
from Hades. They are also represented
as forming one deity. So that we have here an
example&mdash;not the only one&mdash;of a Japanese
Trinity. They have a famous shrine at Sumiyoshi
near Osaka, and are much prayed to for
safety from shipwreck and for fair winds.</p>

<p>Another Sea-god, Toyotama hiko, has been
already mentioned above (p. 31).</p>

<p><b>River-Gods</b> are represented as dragons or
serpents. The resemblance of a river with its
winding serpentine course, and its mysterious
motion without legs, to a great serpent, has
struck mankind in many countries. The Chinese,
the Mexicans, and the Semitic nations concur
in associating water with the serpent. It is
mostly the maleficent aspect of rivers that is
thus symbolised. There are traditions in Japanese
legend of human sacrifices to rivers.</p>

<p><b>Rain-Gods.</b>&mdash;Special Rain-gods are mentioned
in the old myths, but in practice any deity might
be appealed to for aid in time of drought.</p>

<p><b>Wells.</b>&mdash;There are sacred wells from which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the water required in sacrifice was drawn. The
water itself was made a female deity under the
name of Midzuha no me. At the present day,
the ordinary well or stream from which water
is taken for domestic purposes is propitiated early
on the morning of the New Year by small
offerings.</p>

<p><b>Wind-Gods.</b>&mdash;Sometimes one Wind-god is
spoken of, sometimes two, one masculine and one
feminine. They were formerly much prayed to
for good harvests. One legend calls them the
Ame no mihashira and Kuni no mihashira
(august pillar of heaven and august pillar of
earth). The idea that the winds support the sky
is not unknown in other mythologies.</p>

<p><b>Take-mika-dzuchi</b> and <b>Futsunushi</b>.&mdash;The
proper character of these two deities is not quite
clear. The name of the former is frequently
written with Chinese characters which imply
that he is a Thunder-god, and Futsunushi is
probably a god of fire, perhaps more specifically
the lightning. They are constantly associated
in legend and worship. They were sent down
from heaven together to prepare Japan for the
advent of Ninigi, the Sun-Goddess’s grandchild,
and their shrines at Kashima and Katori, on the
east coast of Japan, are adjacent to one another.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
At the present day they are universally recognised
as War-gods. This accounts for the choice
of Kashima and Katori as the names of recently-launched
battle-ships of the Imperial Japanese
Navy. These deities also predict the weather.
The Japanese equivalent of old Moore’s Almanac
is the Kashima no Kotofure, <i>i.e.</i> notification from
Kashima.</p>

<p>There is another Thunder-god called Ikadzuchi
(dread father) or Naru Kami (sounding-god).</p>

<p><b>Fire-Gods.</b>&mdash;<i lang="ja">Kagu-tsuchi</i>, mentioned above (p.
22), is the chief fire-deity. He is also known as
Ho-musubi (fire-growth), and his shrine stands
on the summit of the high hill of Atago near
Kioto. Hence the name Atago-Sama by which
he is usually called. Hill-shrines are dedicated
to him at the chief cities of Japan; and he is
believed, when duly propitiated, to preserve them
from conflagration. In the old State religion the
god and fire are regarded as identical.</p>

<p>The sacrificial fire was deified, and also the
<i lang="ja">Nihabi</i>, a fire kindled with the object of producing
sunshine. Both in ancient and modern
times the domestic cooking-furnace has been
considered as a deity.</p>

<p><b>Ukemochi</b>, the Food-goddess, is one of the two
great gods worshipped at Ise, the Sun-goddess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
being the other. There is a tendency in modern
times to identify her with Inari, a male grain-deity.
Shrines of Inari are to be seen in every
village, and even in many houses. They may be
recognised by two figures of foxes which stand
before them. These animals are thought by many
to be the god himself, and small offerings of such
food as is thought acceptable to foxes are placed
before them. Shinto scholars say that they are
only the god’s attendants or messengers. But
grain is often represented by an animal in other
mythologies, and possibly this may be the case
in Shinto also. Inari is much invoked by the
peasant to grant him good crops, but as is so
often the case, his proper agricultural character
is frequently forgotten, and he is appealed to for
help in all imaginable difficulties, as for the cure
of small-pox or the discovery of a thief.</p>

<p>There are several harvest-gods not very clearly
distinguished from the grain-deities. One of
these, as well as Ukemochi, is said to be the child
of Ohonamochi, the great Earth-god.</p>

<p><b>Tree-Gods.</b>&mdash;Trees of great size and age are
worshipped in almost every village in Japan.
They are girt with honorary cinctures of straw-rope,
and have tiny shrines erected before them.
Other sacred trees are not themselves gods, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
only offerings to the deities before whose shrines
they are planted. Orchard trees are the object of
a quaint ceremony which has its counterpart
in many other places, Devonshire amongst the
number, of cajoling or intimidating the trees
into bearing good crops. In Japan one man
climbs the tree, while another stands at the
bottom with an axe, threatening to cut it down
if it does not promise to bear plentifully. The
man above responds that it will do so. Perhaps,
however, the pleasure of acting a little drama has
more to do with such customs than any real belief
in their efficacy.</p>

<p>We also meet with a Kukunochi (trees-father)
and a Kaya nu hime (reed-lady). Their worship
was probably prompted by gratitude for their
providing materials for house-building and
thatching.</p>

<p><b>A House-God</b> named Yabune is mentioned in
one of the old rituals. A certain sanctity attaches
to the Daikoku-bashira, or central pillar of the
house, corresponding to our king-post. There is
also a Gate-god (or gods), who guards the dwelling
against the entrance of evil things, and, in
modern times, a God of the Privy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gods of Abstractions</span></h3>

<p><b>Izanagi and Izanami.</b>&mdash;I have little doubt
that these deities (see above, <a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>) were
suggested by the Yin and Yang, or male and
female principles, of Chinese philosophy. They
were probably introduced into Japanese myth
in order to account for the existence of the Sun-goddess
and other deities, and to link them
together by a common parentage. Their names
are supposed to be connected with a verb, <i lang="ja">izanafu</i>,
to invite, and to refer to their mutual invitation
to become husband and wife. They are not
important in ritual.</p>

<p><b>Musubi</b> means growth or production. In the
old myths there are two Musubi deities, viz. Taka-musubi
and Kamu-musubi (high-growth and
divine-growth). It is not difficult to conjecture
that ‘high’ and ‘divine’ were originally nothing
more than laudatory epithets of one and the same
personage. Poetry recognises only one God. In
later times there were no fewer than eight Musubi
who had shrines in the precincts of the Imperial
palace. The worship of this god is now much
neglected.</p>

<p><b>Kuni-toko-tachi.</b>&mdash;Nothing is really known of
this deity. The name means literally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> ‘land (or
earth)-eternal-stand,’ and I offer as a mere conjecture
that he is a personification of the durable
character of the earth. The circumstance that
he is the first god of the <cite>Nihongi</cite> myth led to his
receiving a prominence in later times which is
justified by nothing in the older religion. There
was an abortive attempt to make of him a sort of
Supreme Deity, and to substitute his worship for
that of the Food-goddess at Ise.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Deified Individual Men</span></h3>

<p>Though all the greater gods of the old Shinto
were Nature-gods, we cannot affirm that none of
the numerous obscure deities mentioned in the
<cite>Kojiki</cite> and <cite>Nihongi</cite> were deified individual men.
The impulse to exalt human beings to the rank
of deity has always existed, and may have left
traces in the older Shinto, though the evidence
that this was so in any particular case is not
forthcoming.</p>

<p><b>Take-minakata</b>, the god of Suha, in the province
of Shinano, <em>may</em> be a deity of this class.
He was a son of Ohonamochi, who refused allegiance
to the Sun-goddess and fled to Suha, where
he was obliged to surrender. Tradition says that
the present high priests of his shrine are his
direct descendants. They are held to be his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
incarnation, and are called Ikigami or ‘live
deities.’ There are at the present day shrines to
Suha Sama in many parts of Japan.</p>

<p><b>Hachiman</b> is not mentioned in the <cite>Kojiki</cite> or
<cite>Nihongi</cite>. His history is a curious one. The
original place of his worship was Usa in Kiushiu,
near the Straits of Shimonoseki, an old, perhaps
the oldest, Shinto centre of Japan. He first came
into notice in 720, when he helped to repel a
piratical descent by Koreans. At a somewhat
later period he became associated with the great
Minamoto family, and attained to popularity as a
War-god. But his cult is deeply tinctured with
Buddhism. In his oracles he calls himself by
the Buddhist title of Bosatsu (Boddhisattwa),
something like our ‘saint,’ and ordains humanitarian
festivals for the release of living things, a
thoroughly Buddhist institution, and quite incongruous
with his character as a Japanese Mars. It
is explained that the reason for his deification as
a War-god is that he was an unborn child in his
mother Jingo’s womb when she achieved her
famous conquest of Korea. His identification
with the Emperor Ôjin, however, dates from long
after he became popular.</p>

<p><b>Temmangu</b>, the God of Learning and Caligraphy.
If we pass over the honours paid to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
living and dead Mikados as of doubtful religious
quality, the first genuine deified human being on
the Shinto record is Sugahara Michizane, who
was raised to divine rank under the name of
Temmangu. Michizane was born in 845. His
family had a hereditary reputation for learning,
and traced its descent from the Sun-goddess
herself. His erudition gained him high rank in
the government, and a system of national education
which he established acquired for him the
gratitude of the people, who called him the
‘Father of letters.’ But owing to the calumnies
of a rival he was banished to Kiushiu, where he
died in exile. Great calamities followed, which
were attributed to the wrath of Michizane’s ghost,
and it was not until his sentence had been formally
cancelled, shrines erected, and other
honours paid him that it ceased to plague his
enemies and the nation. The story has come
down to us enriched with a profuse embroidery
of legendary details drawn from Buddhist and
Chinese sources.</p>

<p>Temmangu is, or was until recently, one of the
most widely worshipped of Shinto deities, especially
by pedagogues and school-boys. In 1820,
there were twenty-five shrines to him in Yedo
and its neighbourhood. His cult was probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
suggested, and was certainly promoted, by the
corresponding Chinese honours to Confucius.</p>

<p><b>Later Deifications.</b>&mdash;In the Kojiki and Nihongi,
a sort of titular divinity is ascribed to some of the
Mikados. It was not until a later period that
they had shrines or regular offerings. Chief
among deified Mikados are Jimmu, Jingo, and
Kwammu, the founder of Kioto. Takechi no
Sukune, Jingo’s chief counsellor; Prince Yamatodake,
the legendary hero who, in the second
century of our era, subdued the eastern parts of
Japan to the Mikado’s rule; Nomi no Sukune,
the patron deity of wrestlers; Hitomaro, the poet
and Sotoörihime, the poetess, though treated as
ordinary human beings in the old records, were
deified in subsequent times. Quasi-divine honours
are paid to Iyeyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa
dynasty of Shōguns, and to many other distinguished
men. Strange to say, a kind of religious
cult is rendered to remarkable criminals, such as
the famous robber Kumazaka Chōhan, and to
Nishi no Buntaro, who in our own day assassinated
the Minister of Education, Mori Arinori,
because he raised with his walking-stick a curtain
which screened off part of the shrine of Ise from
vulgar gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gods of Classes of Men</span></h3>

<p>In the older Shinto, gods of types or classes
occupy a fairly prominent position. They represent
the hereditary corporations by which the
government of Japan was carried on in early
times. The officials of the Mikado’s Court had
their mythical counterparts in the ministers of the
Sun-goddess, who were supposed to be their
ancestors. Thus the Nakatomi family, who
besides holding other high offices, were the
recognised vicars of the Mikado in the discharge
of his priestly functions, traced their descent
from Koyane, a deity who, by reading a liturgy
in honour of the Sun-goddess, helped to entice
her from the dark Rock-cave of heaven. The
Imbe, who provided the offerings for the state
Shinto ceremonies, recognised as their ancestor a
god called Futo-dama (great offering), who fulfilled
the same office in heaven. Uzume, the
Dread Female of heaven, had descendants in the
female officials of the palace. There is a <i lang="ja">norito</i>
in her honour, in which she is besought to preserve
order among the courtiers of all ranks.
May we not trace a relationship between her and
our own ‘Dread Female’ deity, Mrs. Grundy?
The mirror-makers of the palace had their proto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>type
in Ishikoridome, the jewellers in Toyotama

<h3><span class="smcap">Gods of Human Qualities</span></h3>

<p>Students of Far-Eastern mythology and literature
have observed the feeble grasp of personality
which distinguishes them from the similar products
of the Western mind.<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> They are characterised
by a certain poverty of imagination which
is manifested in various directions, and more
especially by the almost total absence of personified
abstractions of human qualities. We look in
vain for such conceptions as Age, Youth, Love,
Fear, Patience, Hope, Charity, and a host of other
personified qualities. Ta-jikara no wo (hand-strength-male)
is one of the few examples of this
class. He it was who, when the Sun-goddess
partly opened the door of the Rock-cave to
which she had retired, took her by the hand and
dragged her out. But he is little worshipped,
and indeed is only a poetical adjunct to the
mythical narrative. In this respect he greatly
resembles the Kratos and Bia of Hesiod and
Æschylus.</p>

<p><b>Phallic Gods.</b>&mdash;Far more important are the
Sahe no Kami, or phallic deities. Their symbols<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
were a familiar sight by the roadsides and at
crossings in ancient Japan. They might be seen
even in the busy thoroughfares of the capital
itself. At first representatives of the procreative,
life-giving power, they were used as magical
appliances for promoting fertility. But they
became symbolical of life generally&mdash;the enemy
of death and disease&mdash;and, on the well-known
principle of magic that the symbol possesses
something of the actual physical virtue of the
thing which it represents, were employed as prophylactics
against death and pestilence. For
their services in this capacity they were deified.
Their cult has long ago disappeared from the
state religion, but it still lingers in the out-of-the-way
parts of Eastern Japan.</p>

<small>THE PRIESTHOOD</small></h2>


<p>In ancient Japan, the sacred and the secular
were imperfectly differentiated from one another.
The Department of Shinto was simply a Government
bureau. Miya meant equally shrine and
palace. Matsuri, a Shinto festival, is the same
word that we also find in Matsurigoto, government.
The Mikado was at once the high priest
and the sovereign of the nation. In the oldest
legends he appears frequently in a sacerdotal
capacity, and, even at the present day, he takes
a personal part in some of the Shinto rites. Only
last year he went to Ise to perform the ceremony
of Nihiname, or tasting the first rice of the new
harvest after making an offering of it to the Sun-goddess.
But even in the oldest records there
occur instances of his deputing his sacerdotal
functions. Jimmu Tenno is said to have appointed
Michi No Omi (minister-of-the-way) as
‘Ruler of a festival.’ The rubrics of the <cite>norito</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
(rituals) show that they were intended to be read
by a deputy and not by the Mikado in person.</p>

<p><b>The Nakatomi.</b>&mdash;The chief officials of the
Bureau of Shinto were appointed from the hereditary
clan or family of the Nakatomi, from which
the principal ministers of state and the Imperial
Consorts were also selected. The great Fujiwara
House, so famous in later times, was a branch of
the Nakatomi.</p>

<p><b>The Imbe</b> had the duty of preparing the offerings
for sacrifice. Their name, which includes
the word ‘imi,’ signifying religious abstinence,
purity, refers to the strict avoidance of ritual
pollution which was incumbent on them in the
discharge of this function.</p>

<p><b>The Urabe</b> were diviners attached to the
bureau of Shinto.</p>

<p><b>Kannushi</b> is the ordinary word for a Shinto
priest. The Kannushi are not celibates, and are
not distinguishable from the laity except when in
the actual discharge of their functions. Even
the costume which they wear on these occasions
is not properly sacerdotal. It is only an ancient
court uniform. All Shinto priests are appointed
by the civil authorities. They have no ‘cure of
souls,’ and their duties are confined to reading
the litanies and seeing to the repairs of the shrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p><b>Priestesses.</b>&mdash;In ancient times it was the
custom to attach a virgin princess of the Imperial
blood to the great shrine of Ise. All great shrines
have a corps of girl dancers for the performance
of the sacred pantomimes (Kagura). The
latter, on reaching a marriageable age, usually
resign their office, and are merged in the general
population.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />

<small>WORSHIP</small></h2>


<p>With a few exceptions, of no great importance in
Shinto, the outward forms of the worship of the
gods have been previously made use of as tokens
of respect to living men. Whether I take off my
hat to a lady or on entering a church, the act is
the same, it is the ideas associated with it that
make the difference. The word worship must
therefore be used with caution. We ought not,
for example, to assume that ancestor-worship is
necessarily divine worship. It may only mean
acts indicating affection and reverence for the
dead, common to ourselves with non-Christian
peoples, and need not involve any superstitious
belief in a supernatural power exercised by dead
forefathers or heroes. In modern Japan, ancestor-worship
is a comparatively rational cult, and it is
surely undesirable that missionaries should create
for themselves great and needless difficulties by
condemning it indiscriminately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p><b>Gestures of Worship.</b>&mdash;In Shinto, as in other
religions, bowing is a common form of respect to
the gods. It is the custom to bow twice before
and after making an offering. Kneeling is also
known, but is less usual. I have not met with
any case of prostration as an act of adoration.
Clapping hands was in ancient Japan a general
token of respect, now confined to religious worship.
Sometimes a silent hand-clapping is prescribed in
the rituals. Offerings and other objects used in
worship were raised to the forehead as a mark of
reverence.</p>

<p><b>Offerings</b> were in the older Shinto regarded as
tokens of respect, and were not supposed to be
eaten, worn, or otherwise enjoyed by the deity.
There is, however, a more vulgar current of opinion
according to which the god actually benefits in
some obscure physical way by the offerings made
to him.</p>

<p>The general object of making offerings is to
propitiate the god or to expiate offences against
him. Sometimes it is very plainly intimated that
a <i lang="la">quid pro quo</i> is expected.</p>

<p>The original and most important form of offering
was food and drink of various kinds. The
cardinal feature of the great ceremony by which
the Mikado inaugurated his reign was an offering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
of rice and sake to the Sun-goddess. Other food-offerings
were cakes, fruit, vegetables, edible seaweed,
salt, water, and the flesh of deer, pigs, hare,
wild boar, and birds. There were no burnt-offerings
or incense. Next to food, clothing took
the most important place. Hemp and mulberry-bark
fibre, with the stuffs woven from them, are
frequently mentioned. They are now represented
by the Gohei. These are wands to which scollops
of paper are attached, and are to be seen in every
shrine and at every Shinto ceremony. Sometimes
the god is supposed to come down and
take up his temporary abode in the Gohei.</p>

<p>Skins, mirrors, jewels, weapons, and many other
articles are mentioned in the Yengishiki enumerations
of offerings.</p>

<p><b>Human Sacrifice.</b>&mdash;We nowhere hear of human
sacrifices in connection with official Shinto. But
there are several indications of the existence of
this practice in ancient times. River-gods especially
were propitiated by human victims. Human
figures of wood or metal are frequently mentioned,
but it is doubtful whether these were by way of
substitutes for living persons.</p>

<p>Slaves were dedicated to some of the more
important shrines. Presents of horses are often
mentioned. Albinos are usually selected for this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
purpose. They may be seen at the present day
stabled near the entrance to all the important
shrines. Pictures of horses are often substituted
for the animals themselves. Galleries are sometimes
provided for the reception of these and
other <i lang="la">ex voto</i> works of art. The carriage (mikoshi)
in which the deity, or rather his <i lang="ja">shintai</i>, is promenaded
on the occasion of his annual festival is
a very elaborate and costly vehicle. The miya or
shrine may be regarded as a kind of offering.
Miya means august house, and applies equally to
the palace of a sovereign or prince. Originally
there was no building but only a consecrated plot
of ground which was deemed to be the dwelling
of the deity. The miya is not a tomb. The
shrines are purposely small and simple edifices.
In 771 a ‘greater shrine’ had only eighteen feet
frontage. The majority of the existing 150,000 to
200,000 shrines of Japan are tiny structures easily
transportable in a cart or even a wheelbarrow.
To the larger shrines are usually attached an
ema-do (horse-picture hall), a small oratory for
the use of the Mikado’s envoy, and a stage for the
Kagura, or pantomimic dance. A number of
smaller shrines to other gods who are in some
way associated with the chief deity may usually
be seen within the precincts. The approach to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Shinto shrine is marked by one or more honorary
gateways of the special form known as tori-i,
literally bird-rest, from its resemblance to a henroost.
It has its analogues in the Indian turan
and the Chinese pailoo, and is doubtless of exotic
origin. It is not mentioned in the older books.</p>

<p><b>Prayer.</b>&mdash;The <cite>Kojiki</cite> and <cite>Nihongi</cite> contain
scarcely any notices of private individual prayer.
But there are abundant examples in the <cite>Yengishiki</cite>,
and other authorities, of the official
liturgies known as <i lang="ja">norito</i>, addressed by the
Mikado, or his vicars, to various Gods or categories
of Gods, on ceremonial occasions. They
contain petitions for rain in time of drought,
good harvests, preservation from fire, flood, and
earthquake, for children, health and long life to
the sovereign. Sometimes the wrath is deprecated
of deities whose services had been vitiated
by ritual impurity, or whose shrines had been
neglected. Important national events were announced
to them. There were no <i lang="ja">norito</i>
addressed to deceased Mikados before 850, when
Jimmu Tenno was supplicated to spare the life
of the reigning sovereign, who was then dangerously
ill. Shinto prayers are for material blessings
only.</p>

<p><b>Rank of Deities.</b>&mdash;In the seventh century a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
system of official ranks was introduced into Japan
from China. It was extended from the Court
functionaries to the Gods, and was very prevalent
in the eighth century. A curious feature of this
practice was the low rank given to the deities.
It was seldom that they received so high a rank
as that of a Minister of State.</p>

<p><b>Kagura.</b>&mdash;The Kagura, or pantomimic dances
with masks and music, representing some incident
of the mythical narrative, has been at all times a
prominent part of Shinto religious festivals, and,
as in other countries, has become the parent of
the secular drama.</p>

<p><b>Pilgrimages</b> are an ancient institution in
Japan. Even the Mikado paid occasional visits
to the shrines in or near Kioto. At the present
day most Japanese think it a duty to make a
pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime to one
or more of the most famous Shinto fanes, and
believe that their success in life depends on their
doing so. Clubs are formed for the purpose, the
subscriptions going to pay the expenses of these
fortunate members who are selected to represent
their fellows. Pilgrim trains take the place of our
excursion trains. Boys and girls frequently run
away from home in order to make a pilgrimage
to Ise.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />

<small>MORALITY AND PURITY</small></h2>


<p><b>Moral Code.</b>&mdash;Shinto has hardly anything in the
shape of a code of morals. The Ohoharahi, a
service in which the Mikado, by divine authority,
declared to his ministers and people the absolution
of their offences against the gods, makes
no mention of any one of the sins of the Decalogue.
M. Revon, the author of a valuable
treatise on Shinto, challenges this statement,
which I had already made in my <cite>History of
Japanese Literature</cite>. He maintains that from
a comparison of the Decalogue and the Ohoharahi,
‘Il résulte avec évidence que tous les
commandements essentiels du Décalogue (sur le
meurtre, le vol, la fornication, etc.), se retrouvent
dans notre rituel.’<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> In view of the importance of
the subject, and of M. Revon’s acknowledged competence
as a writer on Shinto, it is desirable to
examine this assertion more closely. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> ‘etc.’
puzzles me. I am unable to find in the Ohoharahi
the smallest trace of any of the seven
commandments which it covers, and can only
suppose that it is a mere flourish of M. Revon’s
exuberant imagination. It will be seen that for
the ‘adultery’ of the Decalogue M. Revon has
substituted ‘fornication.’ Is it not a <i lang="fr">cas pendable</i>
to tamper with the ten commandments in this
way? But neither adultery nor fornication are
mentioned in the Ohoharahi. Incest <em>is</em> included
in the latter’s schedule of offences, but, <i lang="la">pace</i> M.
Revon, incest and adultery are distinct offences.
Theft is <em>not mentioned</em> in the Ohoharahi. The
planting of skewers (of offerings in rice-fields) is
one of its offences, but even if the commentator is
right who conjectures that this was done for a
dishonest purpose, I submit that so highly specific
an offence is by no means the same thing as the
far more general theft of the Decalogue. The case
of ‘murder’ of the Mosaic code, and ‘the cutting
of living bodies’ of the Ohoharahi is more complicated.
Murder is at the same time more and
less comprehensive than the corresponding Shinto
offence. The Jewish prohibition is more extensive,
as it includes murder by poison, strangling,
drowning, etc., and it is more restricted as it omits
minor injuries. But there is a profound difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
between the motives which prompted the two
prohibitions. It is the crime of taking away
human life which is condemned in the Decalogue:
the Ohoharahi objects to wounds as nasty,
unsightly things, unmeet for a God to look upon
or to be in any way associated with. Self-inflicted
wounds, the cutting of dead bodies, or wounds
inflicted by others, caused uncleanness just as
much as the wounding of others. Justifiable
homicide required absolution equally with felonious
murder. In a word, the Japanese offence
was ritual, the Jewish moral.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2_2" href="#FNanchor_2_2" class="label">2</a>
See his <cite>Shintoisme</cite>, p. 15, <i>note</i>.</p></div></div>

<p>There are moral elements in the Ohoharahi,
but they are scanty, and M. Revon greatly overestimates
their importance. Not only does it
contain no explicit mention of any of the sins of
the Decalogue&mdash;which is all that I contended for&mdash;but
it has hardly anything which even implicitly
condemns them. Shintoists do not deny
this feature of their religion, but claim that the
absence of a code of ethics is a proof of the
superior natural goodness of the Japanese nation.
It needs no such artificial aids to virtuous
conduct.</p>

<p><b>Purity.</b>&mdash;But if ethics are conspicuously absent
from Shinto, the doctrine of uncleanness holds a
prominent position. Actual personal dirt was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
obnoxious to the gods, as is evidenced by the
frequent mention of bathing and putting on fresh
garments before the discharge of religious functions.
Sexual acts of various kinds, such as the
consummation of a marriage, incest (within narrow
limits), interference with virgin priestesses, menstruation
and child-birth, were accompanied with
disabilities for the service of the gods. Curiously
enough, adultery, though cognisable by the courts
of justice, did not entail religious uncleanness.
Disease, especially leprosy (as in the Mosaic
legislation), wounds and sores involved various
degrees of pollution. The death of a relative,
attendance at a funeral, touching a dead body,
pronouncing or executing a capital sentence, all
incapacitated a man temporarily for the discharge
of religious duties. Lafcadio Hearn thought that
the <i lang="ja">miya</i> or shrine was a development of the
<i lang="ja">moya</i> or mourning house, where the dead bodies
of sovereigns and nobles were deposited until
their costly megalithic tombs could be got ready.
This view harmonises nicely with Herbert Spencer’s
well-known theories, but an ancient Shintoist
would have considered it not only erroneous, but
blasphemous. As in ancient Greece, the gods
had nothing to do with such a polluting thing as
death. Shinto funerals, of which we have heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
a good deal of late, were unknown in ancient
Japan. They date from 1868. Shinto shrines
have no cemeteries attached to them. Eating
flesh was formerly not considered offensive to the
gods, but later, under Buddhist influence, it fell
under prohibition. The fire with which impure
food was cooked also contracted impurity. To
avoid the danger of such defilement, fresh fire
was made by a fire-drill for all the more important
ceremonies. Everything Buddhist, rites, terms,
etc., were at one time placed under a Shinto tabu.
When a festival was approaching, the intending
participant was specially careful to avoid (<i lang="ja">imi</i>)
all possible sources of pollution. He shut himself
up in his house, refrained from speech and noise
and ate food cooked at a pure fire. A special <i lang="ja">imi</i>
of one month was observed by the priests before
officiating at the greater festivals. An <i lang="ja">imi-dono</i>
(sacred hall) was a hall in which purity was
observed, <i lang="ja">imi</i>-axes and <i lang="ja">imi</i>-mattocks were used
to cut the first tree and turn the first sod when
a sacred building was to be erected. If, in spite
of all precaution, defilement took place, consciously
or unconsciously, various expedients were
resorted to for its removal. Lustration was the
most common. After a funeral, it has been the
rule at all periods of Japanese history for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
relatives of the deceased to purify themselves in
this way. Izanagi, after his visit to Hades,
washed in the sea. Salt is sometimes dissolved in
the water used for this purpose, and is employed
in other ways to avert evil influences. Spitting,
rinsing the mouth, and breathing on an object to
which the impurity is communicated, are familiar
practices. Human figures were sometimes breathed
upon and flung into the sea in order to carry off
pollution. In modern times a gohei is shaken
over the person to be purified.</p>

<p><b>Ceremonial</b> is the combination for some specific
purpose of the various elements of worship described
above. The great ceremony of the Shinto
religion is that known as the Ohonihe or Daijôwe,
which means ‘great-food-offering.’ It is the
equivalent of our coronation, and its cardinal
feature was the Mikado’s offering in person to the
god or gods, represented by a cushion, the first
rice of the new harvest, and of sake brewed from
it. A modern Japanese writer says:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘Anciently the Mikado received the auspicious
grain from the Gods of Heaven, and therewithal
nourished the people. In the Daijôwe (or Ohonihe)
the Mikado, when the grain became ripe, joined unto
him the people in sincere veneration, and, as in duty
bound, made return to the Gods of Heaven. He
thereafter partook of it along with the nation. Thus
the people learnt that the grain which they eat is no
other than the seed bestowed on them by the Gods of
Heaven.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The Ohonihe was a most elaborate and costly
function. The preparations were begun months
in advance. In times of scarcity, it had to be
omitted as too great a burden on the nation.</p>

<p><b>The Nihiname</b>, or new-tasting, is the annual
harvest festival when the new season’s rice was
first tasted by the Mikado. The Ohonihe was
only a more sumptuous form of it. The English
counterpart of the Nihiname is Lammas, <i>i.e.</i> loaf-mass,
in which bread made from the new season’s
wheat was used for the first time in the Holy
Communion. There was, in former times, a
household as well as an official celebration of this
rite. Strict people will not eat the new rice
until it is over.</p>

<p><b>The Toshigohi</b> (praying for harvest) was another
important ceremony of the state religion. Not
only the special gods of harvest, but practically
all the divinities were propitiated by offerings,
and a <i lang="ja">norito</i> recited in their honour, of which the
following is a passage:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘If the Sovran Gods will bestow in ears many a
hand’s breadth long and ears abundant the latter
harvest which they will bestow, the latter harvest
produced by the labour of men from whose arms the
foam drips down, on whose opposing thighs the mud
is gathered, I will fulfil their praises by humbly offering
first fruits, of ears a thousand, of ears many a
hundred, raising up the tops of the sake-jars, and
setting in rows the bellies of the sake-jars, in juice and
in ear will I present them, of things growing in the
great moor-plain, sweet herbs and bitter herbs, of
things that dwell in the blue sea-plain, the broad of fin
and the narrow of fin, edible seaweed, too, from the
offing and seaweed from the shore, of clothing, bright
stuffs and shining stuffs, soft stuffs and coarse stuffs&mdash;with
these I will fulfil your praises.’</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Kiu no matsuri</b> (praying for rain) was a service
in which the gods of eighty-five shrines were
asked to send rain. To some of these a black
horse was offered as a suggestion that black rain-clouds
would be welcome.</p>

<p><b>Ohoharahi</b>, great purification or absolution.
This is one of the most curious and interesting of
the great ceremonies of the state religion. It is
often called the Nakatomi no Ohoharahi, because
a member of the Nakatomi priestly clan performed
it on behalf of the Mikado. It was celebrated
twice a year, on the last day of the sixth and of
the twelfth month, with the object of purifying
the ministers of state, officials, and people from
their ceremonial offences committed during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
previous half year. It was also celebrated on occasions
of national calamity, such as an outbreak of
pestilence, or the sudden death of a Mikado.
The offerings made were thrown into a river or
the sea, and were supposed, like the scapegoat of
Israel, to carry with them the sins of the people.
The offences more specifically referred to are
various mischievous interferences with agricultural
operations, flaying animals alive, flaying
backwards, cutting living or dead bodies, leprosy
and other loathsome disease, incest, calamities
from the high gods and from high birds, and
killing animals by bewitchment. There were also
local and individual purifications. In the latter
case, the person to be purified had to pay the
expenses of the celebration, and so a regular
system of fines for such offences came into existence.</p>

<p><b>Ho-shidzume no matsuri</b>, or fire-calming-ceremony.
The object of this rite was to deprecate
the destruction of the Imperial Palace by fire.
The Urabe made fire with a fire-drill and worshipped
it. The service read is anything but
reverent. The Fire-god is reminded that he is ‘an
evil-hearted child’ who caused his mother’s death
when he came into the world, and that she had
come back from Hades purposely to provide the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
means of keeping him in order. If, however, he
would be on his good behaviour, he should have
offerings of the various kinds specified.</p>

<p>Numerous other services are mentioned in the
<cite>Yengishiki</cite>, such as the ‘Luck-wishing of the
Great Palace,’ the <i lang="ja">Michiahe</i>, which is a phallic
ritual for the prevention of pestilence, a festival
in honour of the Food-goddess, one in honour of
the Wind-gods, etc.</p>

<p><b>Modern ceremonies.</b>&mdash;At the present day, most
of the former elaborate ritual of Shinto is neglected
or shorn of its ancient magnificence. One of the
most important state ceremonies which is still
kept up is the <i lang="ja">Naishidokoro</i>, so-called from the
chamber in the palace where it is performed. It
is here that the regalia are kept, consisting of a
mirror which represents the Sun-goddess, a sword,
and a jewel or jewels. The ceremony, which is
performed by the Mikado in person, was formerly
in honour of these sacred objects, but is now
apparently addressed to the tablets of the Emperors
from Jimmu downwards&mdash;an instance of
the progressive development of ancestor-worship
in Shinto. In many private dwellings there is a
Kami-dana (god-shelf) where a harahi, consisting
of a piece of wood from the Ise shrine, and tickets
with the names of any gods whom the household<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
has any special reason for worshipping, are kept.
Lafcadio Hearn says that nowadays there is also
a Mitamaya (august-spirit-dwelling), which is a
model Shinto shrine placed on a shelf fixed
against the wall of some inner chamber. In this
shrine are placed thin tablets of white wood
inscribed with the names of the household dead.
Prayers are repeated and offerings made before
them every day. The annual festivals (<i lang="ja">matsuri</i>)
of the Ujigami or local patron-deity are everywhere
important functions. Offerings are made,
and the god, or rather his emblem, is promenaded
in a procession which reminds one of the carnivals
of Southern Europe. There are Kagura performances
which go on all day and late into the night.
There are also booths for the sale of toys and
sweetmeats, wrestling, fireworks, races, conjurors
and tumblers’ performances. In short, the
<i lang="ja">matsuri</i> is not unlike an English fair. With the
pilgrimages, it does much to help to keep alive
the not very ardent flame of Shinto piety.</p>

<small>DIVINATION AND INSPIRATION</small></h2>


<p><b>Divination.</b>&mdash;The most ancient official method of
divination was by interpreting the cracks made by
fire on the shoulder-blade of a deer. This process
is known in many places from Siberia to Scotland,
in which latter country it is called ‘reading the
speal’ (<i lang="fr">épaule</i>). A tortoise-shell was afterwards
substituted for the deer’s shoulder-blade, in imitation
of China. There was attached to the palace
a college of diviners whose business it was to
ascertain by this means whether a proposed
expedition would be successful, the best site for
a shrine, a tomb, or a dwelling-house, from what
provinces the rice for the Ohonihe should be
taken, etc. etc. With private persons, the Tsuji-ura,
or cross-road divination, was a favourite
method of ascertaining the future. The person
who wished to consult the god went out at dusk
to a cross-roads and inferred the answer to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
question from the chance words spoken by the
first person who made his appearance. Other
kinds of divination were by the sound of a boiling
cauldron, or of a harp, by lots, by beans
boiled in gruel, by the head of a dog or fox
that had been starved to death, and by dreams
and omens. Ordeal was practised by fire and boiling
water.</p>

<p><b>Inspiration.</b>&mdash;There are frequent notices of
oracles in the old records. Legend has preserved
an ‘inspired utterance’ given forth by the Goddess
Uzume before the Rock-cave of Heaven to
which the Sun-goddess had retired. It consists
of the numerals from one to ten! The famous
legendary invasion of Korea by the Empress
Jingo was suggested by a deity. Oracles had
generally reference to the worship of the god
concerned, directing that a shrine should be built
for him, or religious observances inaugurated in
his honour. They were sometimes used for
political purposes. There is evidence that the
inspired person, generally a woman, delivered the
divine message when in a hypnotic trance. This
is undoubtedly the case at the present time. Mr.
P. Lowell’s <cite>Occult Japan</cite> gives a detailed description
of a séance of this kind at which he was
present. There are mediums in Japan as there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
are nearer home, who, for a consideration, will
place their customers in communication with
deceased friends or relatives.</p>

<p>Divination and the hypnotic trance are not
recognised by modern or official Shinto.</p>

<small>LATER HISTORY</small></h2>


<p>Buddhism was introduced into Japan in the sixth
century, but it had at first little influence on the
native religion. Two centuries later a process of
pacific penetration began which had some curious
and important results. The missionaries of Buddhism
applied to the Shinto gods a principle which
had been already adopted in China. They discovered
that whether Nature-gods or Man-gods
they were nothing more than avatars or incarnations
of the various Buddhas. The Sun-goddess,
for example, was made out to be
Vairochana, the Buddhist personification of
essential <i lang="sa">bodhi</i> (enlightenment) and absolute
purity; and deified men received the Buddhist
titles of <i lang="ja">Gongen</i> (avatar) or <i lang="ja">Bosatsu</i> (saint).
Iyeyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa dynasty
of Shoguns, is the Gongen-sama <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>.</p>

<p><b>Ryôbu Shinto</b>, which was in practice little
more than a form of Buddhism, was the result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
of this process. Its principal founder was the
famous Kōbō Daishi. At a later time other
similar schools or sects were originated which
drew their inspiration from Chinese philosophy
or from Buddhism. Under these influences the
true Shinto was much neglected. The Mikados
themselves, after a few years of reign, shaved
their heads and became Buddhist monks. One
of them called himself a slave of Buddha. The
greater Shinto ceremonies were omitted, or worse
still, were performed by Buddhist monks, who
also took possession of many of the Shinto shrines
and celebrated Buddhist rites there.</p>

<p>It should not be forgotten that the foreign
religion contained valuable elements unknown to
the older Shinto, and that the latter had much
to gain by their absorption. The Ryōbu Shinto
inculcated uprightness, purity of heart, charity to
the poor, humanity, and the vanity of mere outward
forms of worship; of all which there is
little trace in the older cult.</p>

<p><b>Chinese Learning.</b>&mdash;The civilisation of Japan
during the Tokugawa dynasty of Shōguns (1603-1868)
was modelled on Chinese originals. Its
moral ideals were drawn from the writings of
the ancient sages Confucius and Mencius, and
the sceptical philosophy of the Sung dynasty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
(960-1278). But in the eighteenth century a
patriotic reaction set in, which strove to establish
more purely national standards of ethics and principles
of government and religion. This movement,
known as the ‘Revival of Pure Shinto,’ was
first revealed to Europeans by a paper contributed
by Sir E. Satow to the <cite>Transactions of the Asiatic
Society of Japan</cite> in 1875. The principal promoters
were Motoöri and his pupil Hirata, two
earnest, able, and stupendously learned writers
who devoted their lives to an endeavour by oral
teaching and in a series of voluminous works to
the dethronement of the established Chinese
ethics and philosophy in favour of a Shinto
purified from Buddhist and other foreign adulterations
of later times. They succeeded to some
extent in this object. It was no doubt partially
owing to their teachings that the Mikado was
restored in 1868 to his sovereign position as the
descendant of the Sun-goddess, the Shinto shrines
purified from Buddhist ornaments and practices,
and the monks expelled from them. In reality
Motoöri and Hirata’s movement was a retrograde
one. The old Shinto, which they wished
to restore, could not possibly hold its own as
the national faith of a people familiar with the
far higher religious and moral ideas of India and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
China, not to speak of civilised Europe. Without
a code of morals, or an efficient ecclesiastical
organisation, with little aid from the arts of
painting, sculpture, and architecture, and with a
sacred literature scanty and feeble compared with
those of its foreign rivals, Shinto is doomed to
extinction. Whatever the religious future of
Japan may be, Shinto will assuredly have little
place in it. Such meat for babes is quite inadequate
as the spiritual food of a nation which in
these latter days has reached a full and vigorous
manhood.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
